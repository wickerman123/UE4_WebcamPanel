A simple editor utility that adds a customisable panel that displays a users's webcam. A fun little challenge from @Luos_83

There's a little bit of setup required. Follow these steps:


 1. Open up the media player at "*/WebcamPanel/Media/MP_Webcam*"
 2. In the top left of the preview, select the folder icon and find your webcam

 5. Now as long as these steps were followed correctly and no refrences were broken along the way, all you need to do now is run the editor utility at "*/WebcamPanel/EW_WebcamPanel*"

#### Options
Click the options button in the top left of the panel to control various options such as the mask, background and chroma key settings (I don't own a greenscreen so I can't guarentee this works well, sorry!)
